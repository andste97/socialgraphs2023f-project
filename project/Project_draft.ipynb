For crying out loud, even America is a socialists country, yet it could hardly be called fascist or communist. But apparently you're too simple-minded to look beyond the stupid labels of right-wing left-wing bullshit, beyond the meaningless names, and see what the real issue is. While I see a reason for socialists and libertarians to unite, you see a reason to remain divided. But until the whole world sheds these stupid labels, it's never going to happen.\n",

      " Being void from bias has never been any one’s downfall and never will be. What you are saying is that nobody in the world says anything void from bias: does that mean there are no (and never will be by the way you’re putting things) reliable resources on Earth?? I think it is clear to anyone form what you have said that YOU are no historian, and in fact you probably never got to grasps with history in the past, definitely not at present, and perhaps (if you carry on with this weird and ignorant idea of yours) not even in the future. If you knew anything about history, or were a historian, then you would have done extensive research from all sorts of sources; some of them will obviously be heavily biased for and against different people, and some will be more neutral, and some things will be absolute facts (e.g.: battles that occurred, and events that happened-such as the procedure of ransoming the western settlers) so again you are wrong, not ‘EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE PLANET’ is biased, You definitely are, but a lot of people aren’t. It is obvious that you are a very stuck up person; just because you are biased you seem to think that surely no one else can be better than you, therefore everyone else must be biased as well, in order that nobody exceeds your majesty in anything.\n",
      " You claim that you are not going to waste your time by posting the ‘500 word rebuttal’ even though you previously mentioned that it was already ‘typed up’. Please clarify how you will be wasting your time if it is already ‘typed up’?? Quite frankly you haven’t typed up any ‘rebuttal’ whatsoever, otherwise you would have posted it to disprove what I have said. The only thing that you have ‘realised’ is that you have now been proven to be a liar in addition to someone who practices plagiarism and doesn’t know a thing about history or its many sources and references. If I were you I’d get typing quickly in order to save your face, because I’m waiting for that ‘rebuttal’ (which will somehow refute the fact that Saladin kept lowering the ransom, and that Ballain and Heraclius were greedy, money hoarding, church looting thieves)\n",
      " As for the fact that I ‘don’t deserve the right to post on Wikipedia’ and that I ‘don’t deserve to be privileged enough to argue with the rest of the people here’, well it’s not for you to decide, because some people would say that you yourself shouldn’t be posting any comments on the crusader discussions page because amongst other things, you haven’t so far countered a thing of what I have said: all you have done was to lose your marbles and stoop down to the level of attempting to insult me by saying I am a ‘fool’ and an ‘idiot’, which shows that you have lost the argument badly (like someone else before you who did a similar thing just because they knew that they had been proven wrong-like you). I am not insulted, because I know who is the real ‘fool’ and the real ‘idiot’; people speak for themselves.\n",
      " ‘Even as I type, I cycle down and read the posts of others who see you as a fool and an idiot.’ What?? You are typing and scrolling at the same time?? Do you think anyone is daft enough to believe that?? You talk nonsense, not only in terms of historical content and bias, but also you seem to talk nonsense in everything. Perhaps you should enact the saying: If you haven’t got anything good to say, then shut up.\n",
      " Apparently ‘EVERY single piece of writing is biased’, what about writings that say things like: ‘German forces have invaded Poland and its planes have bombed Polish cities, including the capital, Warsaw. The attack comes without any warning or declaration of war.’ Are they not fact?? Or do you think they are someone’s bias?? They are clearly historical facts. In the same way, Saladin continued reducing the ransom and made things easier for settlers to leave, Ballain (and especially Heraclius) were greedy and refused to lift the ransom from the settler’s shoulders, Saladin and his brother freed many slaves, prompting Ballain and Heraclius to follow suit, and Heraclius hoarded the western church’s wealth for himself and didn’t use it on behalf of the ransom. The same way, Richard the Lion heart ordered the murder of Muslim families in Acre in front of the Muslim army after one time receiving a late monetary installment due to the large sum he demanded (200 000 gold dinars), is a fact as well, so far, no bias has been added, such as: Richard did nothing to stop the killing. THAT is bias. The fact that I say it was cruel to kill the families just because one installment was late (due to it’s high value, and the Islamic state’s inability to make up the money and pay it on time that once) is no bias, but rather a fact than anything else, no-one can justify the crusader’s killing of them Muslim families in cold blood. The same way, some one who gives to charity is charitable-a fact, someone who helps others is virtuous-a fact, someone who rules a country is called a ruler-a fact, someone who kills civilians is a tyrant-a fact and therefore, Saladin who freed the western slaves and lowered the ransom for their sake is virtuous, not greedy, and merciful (considering what the crusader’s did to Muslims, and the money they had was looted money and property), and the same way, Ballain and Heraclius were greedy and uncharitable and unmerciful to their own people, because they refused to lift the burden off the settlers shoulders from their own money, let alone church money, but instead hoarded it for themselves so they could be rich when they got back home. I am commenting on actions that actually took place: lowering of a ransom, hoarding of church money, allowing people to leave unharmed (even their leaders), making a deal that makes things easier for women and children and weaker members of the community: these are all actions which I am commenting on, unlike you, who claimed that he was only doing it for this and that reasons (which I proved incorrect in my previous comment)\n",
      " Yes, indeed I do ‘interpret’ actions, just like any historian would, e.g.: Hitler shouldn’t have invaded and destroyed Poland’s civilian infrastructure, therefore he was BAD. He killed Jewish civilians, therefore he was BAD. Some apologetics stick up for him and defend him with rubbish arguments, but at the end of the day, and no bias  involved, just interpreting historical facts and actions he did, it is safe to say he was BAD and an AGGRESSOR. The same way crusaders were BAD aggressors, and they were invited over by BAD Western-Roman aggressors and invaders who were afraid they were loosing the land they had occupied In the first place, and the control of its indigenous people, whom they had oppressed.\n",
      " As usual you don’t talk sense: when you said I was ‘claiming things such as “he was noble,” for doing this, etc. Well, that is NOT the event or action’ what on earth do you mean?? Are you mad or drunk?? YOU SAID IT YOURSELF: I called him noble, because he had done so and so, freed slaves, made things easier for the invaders etc. therefore I backed up what I said and explained things to those who were too slow to realize this for themselves, how on earth is it ‘NOT the event or action’, if freeing slaves and making things easier for women and children are not events, then what are events?? Spotted elephants?? Wake up for God’s sake, If you’re not thinking properly or have a problem with understanding English, then come back when you’ve sorted your problems out, because it seems to me you haven’t understood a word of what I have said.\n",
      " You say: ‘‘You aren’t better than me, or anyone else’’. Did I ever say that I was better than anyone?? Are you putting words in my mouth again?? Do you not learn?? You mentioned in your first ever comment on this discussion: ‘’try to keep insults out of the picture’’ and I replied to that part by saying: ‘’And about the ‘insults’ in my previous contribution, well I’d be grateful if you could be a little clearer and specify an ‘insult’ which I said, however, I am sure that you will agree with me that there are none, once you have re-read it thoroughly’’ You couldn’t answer that because there were none, so instead, you decided to not ‘keep insults out of the picture’ and called me a ‘fool’ and an ‘idiot’ – hypocritical!! By calling me a ‘fool’ and an ‘idiot’ you are implying that I am lower than everybody else, because if I was indeed like everyone else, then you are implying that everyone else is like me and are fools and idiots. You have not only broken the Wikipedia rules, but you have also broken any rational person’s trust in you by acting in an ignorant and hypocritical way. And I now reverse what you said to me, and I know say this to you: You are definitely no better than anyone else, and that includes you not being better than me.\n",
      " ‘’therefore your writing is biased, just like mine’’ well, you’ve just admitted (although I already knew) that you are biased, but still that doesn’t bring the level of what I’m writing down to yours, nor does it bring the level of what ‘’EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE PLANET’’ down to the level of bias un-academic inaccuracies based on ignorance which you write, of course there are people like you who don’t understand things properly yet violently support something which doesn’t make sense and has been refuted and believe in bias myths and legends (such as Richard the lion heart was a gallant and noble man, and Saladin was a cunning cut throat child eating baboon) and they directly insult people when they are proven wrong, and tend to have short tempers. But there are a lot of educated individuals out there, who read different sources and look into things and are knowledgeable of what happened and the different accounts and can use facts, logic and reason to come to the truth, so don’t you dare generalize and insult ‘’EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE PLANET’’ by making out that they are somehow like you, who believe in bias and are hard headed, don’t you dare insult people any further.\n",
      " You claim that the key fact was: ‘’The crusaders were called to arms after Jerusalem was taken by the Muslims‘’ Are you telling me that THIS is the key fact which I apparently ‘’successfully left out’’ ?? I purposefully didn’t mention the well known fact that the byzantinians in the Levant called for help because they were loosing their occupied territory, because it is NOT the key fact, the key fact is that there is an aggressor and a defender: the aggressor: crusaders, the defender: Saracens. The fact that the invaders were calling for help because the indigenous people were once again taking control of their land is something the pro crusaders should be ashamed of, not claiming it is the key fact. The crusades were basically reinforcements to Roman invaders to help them quell the rising of the occupied indigenous people. \n",
      " Yes, I am definitely anti crusades, anti invaders, anti aggressors, and I say that myself, and most rational unbiased people educated in the crusader field will agree with me that the crusaders were rapists criminals and aggressors (in addition to thieves and looters). The people who were uprooted and abused were the Saracens, in the same way I am anti Hitler, and most educated unbiased rational people take my stance due to him being an aggressor and a war criminal, and we would ultimately sympathize with those who suffered under him and were invaded, e.g.: Jews gypsies etc. I sympathize with the victims of the brutal crusades-the Muslims. \n",

'' of course it ca n't be because people ( more specifically an interest group ) is fucking up the article and using it to score points . the SSM lobby here does not think their own shit stinks .
